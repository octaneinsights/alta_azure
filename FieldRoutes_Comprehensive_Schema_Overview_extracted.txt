FieldRoutes Data Warehouse: Comprehensive Schema Overview
This reference consolidates the **core fact and dimension tables** for the FieldRoutes operational data warehouse. It reflects the reconciled design vetted against the FieldRoutes Swagger API and business requirements, and it is structured for implementation in Azure Synapse / Azure SQL DW with downstream consumption in Power BI. Each table lists its key fields (business/natural keys, surrogate keys where advised, foreign keys, and critical measures). Surrogate keys (indicated with the _Key suffix) are recommended for slowly‑changing dimensions or where natural keys might not be stable.
